# Data Collection 
## Text Data
To perform the text classification, YouTube videos metadata using YouTube API v3 is collected. This
dataset consists of fields: video id, title, description, hashtags, duration and upload details etc. A total
of more than 10,000 video metadata is collected and divided into six categories. This dataset items
contain a lot of noise which proves to be challenging. Before building a classification model we
should perform data pre-processing. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package of NLP does the job
of pre-processing efficiently. It consists of data pre-processing tools required for text classification.
## Advertisement data
 In order to achieve this various advertisements in the video format are collected and metadata of these are extracted and stored in a database. The advertisement video data consists of information regarding video URL, video id, title, description etc.
